    comment: `It's been an absolute pleasure working with Fabio. I had the opportunity to work with him as part of an implementation project at Aon Hewitt.

I was very impressed with his dedication, strong work ethic, strategic thinking, and subject matter expertise.

He has consistently demonstrated on being a very quick learner, especially with the selected CMS technology that was new for everyone.

More importantly, he also made the time to share his advice and suggestions to provide a valuable client user experience.

I would not hesitate to work with him again, and he is a true asset to any team.`,

    comment: `(translated from Italian) I have known Fabio Rufino since our university days, and I can assure you that you won't find another developer like him. I have also had the pleasure of working with Fabio at both Networld Srl and Vianet Srl.

He truly loves what he does; he is incredibly creative and has a natural talent for writing clean and robust code. Just visit his website to see how skilled Fabio is in managing the technical aspects of the projects he works on. For him, programming is a blend of creativity and science. When it comes to meeting deadlines, his commitment is unwavering.

Fabio is a friend to all who know him, with a deep understanding not only of his field — the Web — but also of the human perspective. He is, in every sense, a "guru." Contact him, and you'll thank me later.`,
